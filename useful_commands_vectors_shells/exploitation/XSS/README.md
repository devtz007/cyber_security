# 🛡️ XSS Polyglots Collection

This repository contains a collection of **XSS polyglots** — crafted payloads that exploit common XSS filtering bypass techniques. These payloads are useful for:

- Penetration testers
- Bug bounty hunters
- CTF players
- Web developers validating sanitization

## 🚨 What is an XSS Polyglot?

An **XSS polyglot** is a single payload designed to bypass multiple types of input sanitization or filtering, often by abusing different contexts (e.g., attribute, tag, script, CSS, JS URI).

They often:

- Mix multiple escaping methods
- Abuse casing (like `jaVasCript:`)
- Exploit misconfigured HTML parsers
- Chain multiple fallback triggers
